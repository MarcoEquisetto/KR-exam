Tests done to check reasoner consistency:

TEST 1: Critical Patient 
Tests inference logic

- Create an ICU Department: IntensiveCareUnit -> ICU_Ward_1.
- Data Property Assertion: bedCount -> 10 (integer).
- Create a Patient: Patient -> John_Doe.
- Object Property Assertion: admittedTo -> ICU_Ward_1.
- Data Property Assertion: isCritical -> true (boolean).
- Data Property Assertion: personID -> "12345" (string).

----> TEST REASONER = Reasoner correctly derives that John_Doe is a CriticalPatient



TEST 2: The "Surgery Validation"
Tests strict cardinality/subclass constraints (e.g., that a surgery must have an anesthesiologist).

- Create Staff: Surgeon -> Dr_Smith.
- Create an Anesthesiologist: Dr_Jones.
- Create a Nurse: Nurse_Betty.
- Create a Surgery -> Heart_Transplant_001.
- Object Property Assertion: performedBy -> Dr_Smith.
- Data Property Assertion: surgeryDurationMinutes -> 240.
